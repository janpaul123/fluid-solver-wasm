# Fluid Solver in WebAssembly

Quick experiment in learning how to compile an existing application to WebAssembly.

Based on “A Simple Fluid Solver Based on the FFT” by Jos Stam, original code at https://github.com/erich666/jgt-code/blob/master/Volume_06/Number_2/Stam2001

Compile using `make`, then open index.html. Requires Emscripten.
